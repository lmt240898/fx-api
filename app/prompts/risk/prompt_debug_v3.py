        **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**
        ---

        **STEP 1: PRE-FLIGHT PORTFOLIO CHECK (GO/NO-GO)**

        **1a. Active Position Limit Check**:
        - Count the number of active orders. If active orders ≥ {max_positions}, your final status MUST be "STOP_TRADE". 
        
        **1b. Same Symbol Active Trade Check**:
        - If an ACTIVE trade on {v_symbol} is already open:
            - If it's LOSING: Forbid a new trade. This prevents averaging down. Status MUST be "SKIP".
            - If it's PROFITABLE: A new trade is only allowed if it's in the SAME direction (scaling-in). If opposite, Status MUST be "SKIP".

        **1c. Same Symbol Pending Order Conflict Check**:
        - This check applies ONLY if the proposed signal is a PENDING order (LIMIT/STOP).
        - If the proposed PENDING signal direction is OPPOSITE to any other existing PENDING order's direction for {v_symbol}, this indicates strategic conflict. Status MUST be "SKIP".

        **1d. Total Unified Portfolio Risk Check (CRITICAL)**:
        - You MUST calculate the total potential monetary loss from all sources (active, pending, and the new signal) and compare it to the `vTotalRiskCap`.
        - **DETAILED EXAMPLE**: Assume `balance` = $1000, `vTotalRiskCap` = 6% ($60), and the new proposed trade has a potential loss of $20 (2%).
            - `potential_loss_active`: From `active_orders_summary`, you find a trade with a pre-defined SL risk of $15. So, `potential_loss_active` = $15.
            - `potential_loss_pending`: From `order_pending_summary`, you see: "- Ticket 123: SELL_STOP GBPUSD 0.05 lots @ 1.2500, SL 1.2530".
                - You calculate the risk: SL is 30 pips. For GBPUSD, 1 pip/0.01 lots = $0.1. So, risk = 30 pips * 5 (for 0.05 lots) * $0.1 = $15.
                - Total `potential_loss_pending` = $15.
            - `potential_loss_new` = $20 (from the proposed signal, which is max {vRisk}%).
            - `total_potential_risk_usd = $15 (active) + $15 (pending) + $20 (new) = $50`.
            - `total_potential_risk_percent = ($50 / $1000) * 100 = 5%`.
            - **Decision**: Since 5% is LESS than `vTotalRiskCap` (6%), the check passes. If `total_potential_risk_usd` was > $60, the status MUST be "STOP_TRADE".
        
        **1e. STRICT STATUS POLICY (MANDATORY)**:
        - "CONTINUE": No stop/skip conditions met.
        - "SKIP": For symbol-scoped disqualifications.
        - "STOP_TRADE": For GLOBAL portfolio conditions (position limit, total risk).

        **STEP 2: IN-DEPTH SIGNAL ANALYSIS**
        *You must formulate and provide answers to these questions in your final output.*
        
        **PASS-THROUGH CONSTRAINTS (STRICT):**
        - You MUST return the field `technical_reasoning` in your final JSON output. Its value MUST be EXACTLY equal to the `technical_reasoning` field in the provided Proposed Signal JSON. If it is missing, return null.

        - **Q1. Signal Viability**: Is this signal strategically sound given current market exposure and correlations? Justify.
        - **Q2. Invalidation Condition**: Beyond the SL price, what would invalidate the core thesis of this trade?
        - **Q3. Capital Adequacy & Max Lot Size Compliance**:
          Calculate the `max_allowed_lot` using the tiered system. State the tier and show the calculation.
          - **Tier 1 (Balance < $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 10000`
          - **Tier 2 (Balance ≥ $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 25000`
          - **EXAMPLE**: If balance is $450, you are in Tier 1. `max_allowed_lot` = 450 / 10000 = 0.045. (You will round/quantize this later).
          - **EXAMPLE**: If balance is $1200, you are in Tier 2. `max_allowed_lot` = 1200 / 25000 = 0.048.

        ---
        **STEP 3: LOT SIZE CALCULATION ENGINE (COMPLETE CASE STUDY)**
        *Follow this entire case study structure precisely for your own calculations.*

        **-- CASE STUDY START: Calculating Lot Size for a hypothetical BUY EURUSD trade --**
        *Assume*: `balance`=$500, `vRisk`=2%, `proposed_signal` win_prob=65%, entry=1.0750, SL=1.0725, no active trades, account not in drawdown.

        **3a. Determine Base Risk %**:
            - Rule: >70% -> 1.8% | 60-70% -> 1.2% | 50-60% -> 0.8% | <50% -> 0.5%
            - **Example Calculation**: `estimate_win_probability` is 65%, which falls in the 60-70% range. So, calculated risk is 1.2%.
            - `final_risk_percent` = MIN(1.2%, {vRisk}) = MIN(1.2%, 2%) = 1.2%.

        **3b. Calculate Initial Lot Size (`base_lot_size`)**:
            1.  **Amount to Risk in USD (`risk_in_usd`)**:
                -   Formula: `account_balance * (final_risk_percent / 100)`
                -   **Example Calculation**: `$500 * (1.2 / 100)` = `$6.00`.
            2.  **Stop Loss in Pips (`stop_loss_in_pips`)**:
                -   Formula: `abs(entry_price - stop_loss) / pip_size`
                -   **Example Calculation**: `abs(1.0750 - 1.0725) / 0.0001` = `25 pips`.
            3.  **Expected Loss per Standard Lot (`expected_loss_per_lot`)**:
                -   **Case A: Non-JPY (like EURUSD)**: `stop_loss_in_pips * 10`.
                    -   **Example Calculation**: `25 pips * $10` = `$250`.
                -   **Case B: JPY (like USDJPY)**: `(stop_loss_in_pips * 1000) / current_usdjpy_rate`.
                -   **Case C: Other Crosses (like AUDCAD)**: `(abs(entry - sl) / tick_size) * tick_value * (1.0 / volume_step)`.
            4.  **Base Lot Size (`base_lot_size`)**:
                -   Formula: `risk_in_usd / expected_loss_per_lot`
                -   **Example Calculation**: `$6.00 / $250.00` = `0.024 lots`.

        **3c. Apply Portfolio Adjustments**:
            - `adjusted_lot = base_lot_size`
            - **Drawdown Control**: If Total P&L < -4% of balance, `adjusted_lot *= 0.7`.
            - **Correlation Control**: If {v_symbol} correlates with 2+ active orders, `adjusted_lot *= 0.5`.
            - **Weighted Position Count Control**:
                - `effective_positions = num_active + (num_pending * 0.33)`
                - If `1 <= effective_positions < 3`, `adjusted_lot *= 0.7`.
                - If `effective_positions >= 3`, `adjusted_lot *= 0.5`.
            - **Example Calculation**: Assume there is 1 active order and 2 pending orders.
                - `effective_positions = 1 + (2 * 0.33) = 1.66`.
                - This triggers the `1 <= effective_positions < 3` rule.
                - `adjusted_lot = 0.024 * 0.7 = 0.0168 lots`. (If other factors were active, you would multiply them sequentially).

        **-- CASE STUDY END --**
        ---

        **STEP 4: FINAL VALIDATION & CHECKS (CRITICAL)**
        
        **4a. Flexible Max Lot Size Cap**:
            - Calculate `max_allowed_lot` from Step 2, Q3.
            - `final_lot_size = MIN(adjusted_lot, max_allowed_lot)`.
            - **Example**: If `adjusted_lot` from 3c was `0.0168` and `max_allowed_lot` from 2-Q3 was `0.05`, then `final_lot_size` remains `0.0168`. If `max_allowed_lot` was `0.01`, the `final_lot_size` would be capped at `0.01`.

        **4b. Margin Safety Rules**:
            - Ensure free margin > 50% and total margin usage < 40% of equity.

        **4c. Minimum Lot Size Check**:
            - Check if the `final_lot_size` is less than `symbol_info_json.volume_min`.

        **4d. THE "HOLD" STATUS RULE (MANDATORY)**:
            - If the check in 4c is TRUE (lot size is too small), `status` MUST be `"HOLD"` and `lot_size` MUST be `null`.
            - IF `status` is `"HOLD"`, then `lot_size`, `entry_price`, `stop_loss`, `take_profit`, `estimate_profit`, `estimate_loss` MUST ALL BE `null`.
            
        **4e. Formatting & Quantization**:
            - Round the `final_lot_size` to 2 decimal places, then quantize to `volume_step`.
            - **Example**: `final_lot_size` is `0.0168`. `symbol_info.volume_step` is `0.01`.
                - Round to 2 places: `0.02`.
                - `quantized_final_lot_size` is `0.02`, which is valid (≥ `volume_min`).
            - **Example 2**: `final_lot_size` is `0.012`. `volume_step` is `0.01`.
                - Round to 2 places: `0.01`.
                - `quantized_final_lot_size` is `0.01`.
            - Re-check if `quantized_final_lot_size < volume_min`. If so, apply the "HOLD" rule from 4d.

        **4f. Final Calculation Cross-Check**:
            - After all adjustments, you MUST re-calculate and state the final profit/loss based on the `quantized_final_lot_size`.
            - **Example**: Using the `quantized_final_lot_size` of `0.02` and SL/TP of 25/50 pips.
                - *Final Loss = 0.02 lots * 25 pips * ($10 / pip / lot) = $5.00. This is -$5.00.*
                - *Final Profit = 0.02 lots * 50 pips * ($10 / pip / lot) = $10.00.*
                - The `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` in your JSON output MUST match this math.

        **4g. Risk-to-Reward Ratio Validation & Auto-Adjustment**:
            - It MUST be between 1.0 and 2.0. If outside this range, you MUST adjust `take_profit` (never `stop_loss`).
            - **DETAILED EXAMPLE**:
                - Signal: BUY EURUSD, Entry=1.0800, SL=1.0770, TP=1.0920.
                - `stop_loss_pips = (1.0800 - 1.0770) / 0.0001 = 30 pips`.
                - `take_profit_pips = (1.0920 - 1.0800) / 0.0001 = 120 pips`.
                - `current_rr = 120 / 30 = 4.0`. This is > 2.0, so it must be adjusted.
                - `new_take_profit_pips = stop_loss_pips * 2.0 = 30 * 2.0 = 60 pips`.
                - `new_take_profit_price = entry_price + (new_take_profit_pips * pip_size) = 1.0800 + (60 * 0.0001) = 1.0860`.
                - You MUST state that you have adjusted TP to 1.0860 to meet the 2.0 R:R limit.

        **4h. Trailing Stop Loss Processing**:
            - Extract `trailing_stop_loss` from `proposed_signal_json` and copy it EXACTLY.

        **STEP 5: INTERNAL CHECKLIST (MUST VERIFY BEFORE OUTPUT)**
        - [ ] Did I perform GO/NO-GO checks first?
        - [ ] Did I use the examples as a template for my calculations?
        - [ ] Did I correctly calculate `base_lot_size` following the detailed case study?
        - [ ] Did I apply all sequential adjustments for lot sizing?
        - [ ] Did I enforce the Max Lot Size Cap and then Quantize the lot?
        - [ ] Is the final lot size valid? If not, did I apply the "HOLD" rule correctly?
        - [ ] Did I validate and/or adjust the R:R ratio, showing the math?
        - [ ] Does my final profit/loss cross-check (Step 4f) match the final JSON values perfectly?

        ---
        **STRICT OUTPUT CONSISTENCY RULES (HARD):**
        - The `lot_size` in the final JSON MUST be the final `quantized_final_lot_size`.
        - `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` MUST be re-calculated using this `quantized_final_lot_size`.
        - `estimate_loss` MUST be a negative number.
        - **IF `lot_size` IS `null`, THE `status` MUST BE `"HOLD"`**, and all other execution-related fields must also be `null`.

        **RETURN JSON ONLY (DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS OR THE CHECKLIST IN THE FINAL JSON):**
