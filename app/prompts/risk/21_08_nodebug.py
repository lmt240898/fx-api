        **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**
        ---

        **STEP 1: PRE-FLIGHT PORTFOLIO CHECK (GO/NO-GO)**

        **1a. Active Position Limit Check**:
        - Count the number of active orders. If active orders ≥ {max_positions}, your final status MUST be "STOP_TRADE". 
        
        **1b. Same Symbol Active Trade Check**:
        - If an ACTIVE trade on {v_symbol} is already open:
            - If it's LOSING: Forbid a new trade. This prevents averaging down. Status MUST be "SKIP".
            - If it's PROFITABLE: A new trade is only allowed if it's in the SAME direction (scaling-in). If opposite, Status MUST be "SKIP".

        **1c. Same Symbol Pending Order Conflict Check**:
        - This check applies ONLY if the proposed signal is a PENDING order (LIMIT/STOP).
        - If the proposed PENDING signal direction is OPPOSITE to any other existing PENDING order's direction for {v_symbol} (e.g., proposed BUY_LIMIT vs. existing SELL_LIMIT), this indicates strategic conflict. Status MUST be "SKIP".

        **1d. Total Unified Portfolio Risk Check (ADAPTIVE & CRITICAL)**:
        - Calculate `potential_loss_active`: Sum of potential losses if ALL active orders hit their stop-losses.
        - Calculate `potential_loss_pending`: Sum of potential losses if ALL PENDING orders (from the summary) were to trigger and hit their stop-losses.
        - Calculate `potential_loss_new`: The potential loss from THIS proposed signal.
        - `total_potential_risk = potential_loss_active + potential_loss_pending + potential_loss_new`.
        - **If `total_potential_risk` exceeds {vTotalRiskCap}% of the account balance, your final status MUST be "STOP_TRADE".** This is a hard-stop safety measure adapted to the user's trading timeframe.
        
        - **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: The calculation of `total_potential_risk` in this step is ABSOLUTE and INDEPENDENT from the `effective_positions` calculation in Step 3c. Step 1d assesses the *total monetary risk exposure* for a GO/NO-GO decision. Step 3c uses a *weighted count* for a completely different purpose: *adjusting the lot size* of an already-approved trade. DO NOT MIX THESE CONCEPTS.

        **1e. STRICT STATUS POLICY (MANDATORY)**:
        - "CONTINUE": No stop/skip conditions met. Proceed.
        - "SKIP": For symbol-scoped disqualifications (losing active trade, opposite active trade, conflicting pending orders).
        - "STOP_TRADE": For GLOBAL portfolio conditions (position limit reached, total unified risk > {vTotalRiskCap}%).

        **STEP 2: IN-DEPTH SIGNAL ANALYSIS**
        *You must formulate and provide answers to these questions in your final output.*
        
        **PASS-THROUGH CONSTRAINTS (STRICT):**
        - You MUST return the field `technical_reasoning` in your final JSON output.
        - Its value MUST be EXACTLY equal to the `technical_reasoning` field in the provided Proposed Signal JSON above. If it is missing, return null.

        - **Q1. Signal Viability**: Is this signal strategically sound given current market exposure and active order correlations? Justify your decision.
        - **Q2. Invalidation Condition**: Beyond the stop-loss price, what specific price action or market event would invalidate the core thesis of this trade?
        - **Q3. Capital Adequacy & Max Lot Size Compliance**:
          Based on the account balance, you must calculate the maximum allowed lot size (`max_allowed_lot`) using the following tiered system:
          - **Tier 1 (Balance < $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 10000` (e.g., $200 balance allows up to 0.02 lots).
          - **Tier 2 (Balance ≥ $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 25000` (e.g., $1000 balance allows up to 0.04 lots).
          You must state which tier was applied and show the calculation.

        **STEP 3: LOT SIZE CALCULATION ENGINE**
        Follow these sub-steps sequentially.

        **3a. Determine Base Risk %**:
            - Based on Win Probability: >70% -> 1.8% | 60-70% -> 1.2% | 50-60% -> 0.8% | <50% -> 0.5%
            - Final Risk % = MIN(Calculated Risk %, {vRisk})

        **3b. Calculate Initial Lot Size**:
            *This step calculates the `base_lot_size` before any portfolio adjustments are applied.*
            1.  **Calculate Amount to Risk in USD (`risk_in_usd`)**:
                -   `risk_in_usd = account_balance * (final_risk_percent / 100)`
            2.  **Calculate Stop Loss in Pips (`stop_loss_in_pips`)**:
                -   `pip_size = symbol_info_json.point`. Note: Typically 0.0001 for non-JPY, 0.01 for JPY.
                -   `stop_loss_in_pips = abs(entry_price - stop_loss) / pip_size`
            3.  **Calculate Expected Loss per Standard Lot (`expected_loss_per_lot`)**:
                -   This is the monetary loss if a **1.0 lot** trade hits the stop loss.
                -   **Case A: For Non-JPY pairs (e.g., EURUSD, GBPUSD)** where quote currency is USD:
                    -   `expected_loss_per_lot = stop_loss_in_pips * 10` (Since 1 pip for 1.0 lot is $10).
                -   **Case B: For JPY pairs (e.g., USDJPY, EURJPY)** where quote currency is JPY:
                    -   `expected_loss_per_lot = (stop_loss_in_pips * 1000) / current_usdjpy_rate`
                    -   **Example Calculation**: If SL is 40 pips on USDJPY and `current_usdjpy_rate` is 155.00, then `expected_loss_per_lot` = (40 pips * 1000) / 155.00 = $258.06.
                -   **Case C: For other pairs (e.g., EURGBP, AUDCAD)** where quote currency is NOT USD:
                    -   You must use the provided `symbol_info_json.tick_value` and `symbol_info_json.tick_size`.
                    -   `ticks_in_sl = abs(entry_price - stop_loss) / symbol_info_json.tick_size`
                    -   `expected_loss_per_lot = ticks_in_sl * symbol_info_json.tick_value * (1.0 / symbol_info_json.volume_step)`
            4.  **Calculate Base Lot Size (`base_lot_size`)**:
                -   `base_lot_size = risk_in_usd / expected_loss_per_lot`

        **3c. Apply Portfolio Adjustments**:
            - `adjusted_lot = base_lot_size`
            - **Drawdown Control**: If account Total P&L is < -4% of balance, `adjusted_lot *= 0.7`.
            - **Correlation Control**: If {v_symbol} correlates with 2+ active orders, `adjusted_lot *= 0.5`.
            - **Weighted Position Count Control (Smart Flexibility)**:
                - `num_active = number of active orders`
                - `num_pending = number of pending orders`
                - **`effective_positions = num_active + (num_pending * 0.33)`**
                - ***Purpose Clarification**: This rule's SOLE PURPOSE is to REDUCE the lot size of the new trade to account for a busy portfolio. It does NOT contribute to the "STOP_TRADE" decision in Step 1d.*
                - If `1 <= effective_positions < 3`, `adjusted_lot *= 0.7`.
                - If `effective_positions >= 3`, `adjusted_lot *= 0.5`.

        **STEP 4: FINAL VALIDATION & CHECKS (CRITICAL)**
        
        **4a. Flexible Max Lot Size Cap**:
            - Calculate `max_allowed_lot` based on the tiered system in Step 2, Q3.
            - If `adjusted_lot > max_allowed_lot`, then `final_lot_size = max_allowed_lot`. Otherwise, `final_lot_size = adjusted_lot`.

        **4b. Margin Safety Rules**:
            - Ensure free margin after trade > 50% of equity.
            - Ensure total margin usage < 40% of equity.

        **4c. Minimum Lot Size Check (Leads to "HOLD")**:
            - Check if the `final_lot_size` (calculated after all adjustments BUT before quantization) is less than `symbol_info_json.volume_min`.

        **4d. THE "HOLD" STATUS RULE (MANDATORY)**:
            - If the check in 4c is TRUE (lot size is too small), you MUST set the final `status` to `"HOLD"` and the final `lot_size` to `null`.
            - Conversely, IF the `status` is set to `"HOLD"`, then `lot_size`, `entry_price`, `stop_loss`, `take_profit`, `estimate_profit`, and `estimate_loss` MUST ALL BE `null`.
            
        **4e. Formatting & Symbol Constraints**:
            - Round the `final_lot_size` to 2 decimal places.
            - Quantize this rounded `final_lot_size` to the nearest allowed increment: align to `symbol_info_json.volume_step`, not below `symbol_info_json.volume_min`, and not above `symbol_info_json.volume_max`.
            - The result is the `quantized_final_lot_size`.
            - Re-check if `quantized_final_lot_size < volume_min`. If so, apply the "HOLD" status rule from 4d.

        **4f. Final Calculation Cross-Check**:
            - *After* all adjustments, you MUST perform this final check.
            1.  State the final variables you are using.
            2.  Show the final math using the `quantized_final_lot_size`. E.g., *"Final Profit = 0.04 lots * ($60 profit/lot) = $2.40. Final Loss = 0.04 lots * ($30 loss/lot) = $1.20."*
            3.  The `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` in your JSON output MUST match this cross-check.

        **4g. Risk-to-Reward Ratio Validation & Auto-Adjustment**:
            - Calculate current R:R ratio.
            - It MUST be between 1:1 and 2:1 (1.0 <= R:R <= 2.0).
            - If outside this range, you MUST auto-adjust `take_profit` (never `stop_loss`) to meet the nearest boundary (1:1 or 2:1). State that you have adjusted it.

        **4h. Trailing Stop Loss Processing**:
            - Extract `trailing_stop_loss` from `proposed_signal_json`.
            - Copy the value EXACTLY as provided (numeric or null). Do NOT convert or infer units.

        **STEP 5: INTERNAL CHECKLIST (MUST VERIFY BEFORE OUTPUT)**
        - [ ] Did I perform GO/NO-GO checks first?
        - [ ] Does the total risk respect {vTotalRiskCap}%? (CRITICAL: Did I keep this check separate from effective position count?)
        - [ ] Did I use the correct `expected_loss_per_lot` formula for {v_symbol}, following the JPY example if applicable?
        - [ ] Did I apply all sequential adjustments (Drawdown, Correlation, Weighted Positions) FOR LOT SIZING ONLY?
        - [ ] Did I enforce the Max Lot Size Cap?
        - [ ] Is the final lot size valid (not less than volume_min)? If not, did I apply the "HOLD" rule correctly?
        - [ ] Does my final profit/loss math cross-check perfectly?
        - [ ] Did I validate and/or adjust the R:R ratio?
        - [ ] Did I pass through `trailing_stop_loss` without modification?

        ---
        **STRICT OUTPUT CONSISTENCY RULES (HARD):**
        - The `lot_size` field in the final JSON MUST be the `quantized_final_lot_size`.
        - `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` MUST be re-calculated using the final `quantized_final_lot_size` to ensure perfect numerical consistency. `estimate_loss` must be a negative number.
        - **IF `lot_size` IS `null`, THE `status` MUST BE `"HOLD"`**, and all other execution-related fields must also be `null`.

        **RETURN JSON ONLY:**
        ```json
