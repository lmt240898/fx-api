        **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**
        ---

        **STEP 1: ABSOLUTE PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (GO / NO-GO / HALT)**
        *You MUST process these checks in order. If any check results in 'SKIP' or 'STOP_TRADE', you MUST HALT IMMEDIATELY and output the corresponding status. DO NOT proceed to Step 2.*

        **1a. Active Position Limit Check**:
        - Count active orders. If active orders ≥ {max_positions}, your final status MUST be "STOP_TRADE". HALT.
        
        **1b. Same Symbol Active Trade Check**:
        - If an ACTIVE trade on {v_symbol} is open:
            - If LOSING: Forbid a new trade. This prevents averaging down. Status MUST be "SKIP". HALT.
            - If PROFITABLE: A new trade is only allowed if in the SAME direction (scaling-in). If opposite, Status MUST be "SKIP". HALT.

        **1c. Same Symbol Pending Order Conflict Check**:
        - This applies ONLY if the proposed signal is a PENDING order.
        - If the proposed PENDING signal direction is OPPOSITE to any other existing PENDING order's direction for {v_symbol}, Status MUST be "SKIP". HALT.

        **1d. Total Unified Portfolio Risk Check (CRITICAL)**:
        - Calculate `potential_loss_active`: Sum of potential losses of ALL active orders.
        - Calculate `potential_loss_pending`: Sum of potential losses of ALL PENDING orders.
        - Calculate `potential_loss_new`: The potential loss from THIS proposed signal.
        - `total_potential_risk = potential_loss_active + potential_loss_pending + potential_loss_new`.
        - **If `total_potential_risk` exceeds {vTotalRiskCap}% of the account balance, your final status MUST be "STOP_TRADE". HALT.**
        
        **STEP 2: IN-DEPTH SIGNAL ANALYSIS (Only if Step 1 is passed)**
        *Provide answers to these questions in your final thinking process.*
        
        **PASS-THROUGH CONSTRAINTS (STRICT):**
        - You MUST return the field `technical_reasoning` in your final JSON. Its value MUST be EXACTLY equal to the `technical_reasoning` in the Proposed Signal. If missing, return null.

        - **Q1. Signal Viability**: Is this signal strategically sound given market exposure?
        - **Q2. Invalidation Condition**: What would invalidate the trade thesis beyond the SL price?
        - **Q3. Capital Adequacy & Max Lot Size Compliance**:
          Based on the account balance, calculate `max_allowed_lot`:
          - **Tier 1 (Balance < $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 10000`.
          - **Tier 2 (Balance ≥ $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 25000`.
          State the applied tier and calculation.

        **STEP 3: LOT SIZE CALCULATION ENGINE**
        Follow these sub-steps sequentially.

        **3a. Determine Base Risk %**:
            - Based on Win Probability: >70% -> 1.8% | 60-70% -> 1.2% | 50-60% -> 0.8% | <50% -> 0.5%
            - `final_risk_percent` = MIN(Calculated Risk %, {vRisk})

        **3b. Calculate Initial Lot Size (IMPERATIVE LOGIC)**:
            1.  **Calculate Amount to Risk in USD (`risk_in_usd`)**:
                -   `risk_in_usd = account_balance * (final_risk_percent / 100)`
            2.  **Calculate Stop Loss Distance (`stop_loss_distance`)**:
                -   `stop_loss_distance = abs(entry_price - stop_loss)`
            3.  **Calculate Expected Loss per Standard Lot (`expected_loss_per_lot`)**:
                -   **MANDATORY**: You MUST explicitly state which of the following two formulas (JPY or NON-JPY) you are using.
                -   **Path A: For JPY pairs (quote currency is JPY)**
                    -   `stop_loss_in_pips = stop_loss_distance / 0.01`
                    -   `expected_loss_per_lot = (stop_loss_in_pips * 1000) / current_usdjpy_rate`
                    -   Example: SL 40 pips, USDJPY rate 155.00 -> `expected_loss_per_lot` = (40 * 1000) / 155.00 = $258.06.
                -   **Path B: For ALL NON-JPY pairs (e.g., EURUSD, AUDCAD, XAUUSD)**
                    -   `ticks_in_sl = stop_loss_distance / symbol_info_json.trade_tick_size`
                    -   `expected_loss_per_lot = ticks_in_sl * symbol_info_json.trade_tick_value`
                    -   **THIS FORMULA IS CORRECT AND REPLACES ALL OTHER NON-JPY CASES. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER FORMULA.**
            4.  **Calculate Base Lot Size (`base_lot_size`)**:
                -   **MANDATORY**: You MUST show the math: `base_lot_size = risk_in_usd / expected_loss_per_lot`.
                -   `base_lot_size = risk_in_usd / expected_loss_per_lot`

        **3c. Apply Sequential Portfolio Adjustments**:
            - `adjusted_lot = base_lot_size`
            - **Drawdown Control**: If account Total P&L < -4% of balance, `adjusted_lot *= 0.7`.
            - **Correlation Control**: If {v_symbol} correlates with 2+ active orders, `adjusted_lot *= 0.5`.
            - **Weighted Position Control**:
                - `effective_positions = num_active + (num_pending * 0.33)`
                - If `1 <= effective_positions < 3`, `adjusted_lot *= 0.7`.
                - If `effective_positions >= 3`, `adjusted_lot *= 0.5`.

        **STEP 4: FINAL VALIDATION & SANITIZATION (CRITICAL)**
        
        **4a. Flexible Max Lot Size Cap**:
            - `max_allowed_lot` is from Step 2, Q3.
            - `final_lot_size = MIN(adjusted_lot, max_allowed_lot)`.

        **4b. Margin Safety Rules**:
            - Ensure free margin after trade > 50% of equity.
            - Ensure total margin usage < 40% of equity. If this check fails, the status MUST become 'HOLD'.

        **4c. THE "HOLD" STATUS RULE (MANDATORY)**:
            - If the `final_lot_size` (calculated after all adjustments) is less than `symbol_info_json.volume_min`, you MUST set the final `status` to `"HOLD"` and the final `lot_size` to `null`.
            - If status is `"HOLD"`, ALL execution fields (`lot_size`, `entry_price`, etc.) MUST be `null`.

        **4d. Formatting & Quantization**:
            - Round `final_lot_size` to the number of decimal places in `symbol_info_json.volume_step`.
            - Quantize this rounded `final_lot_size` to the nearest allowed increment as defined by `symbol_info_json.volume_step`.
            - The result is `quantized_final_lot_size`.
            - Re-check: if `quantized_final_lot_size < volume_min`, apply the "HOLD" rule from 4c.

        **4e. MANDATORY Risk-to-Reward Ratio (R:R) Sanctity Check**:
            - It MUST be between 1.0 and 2.0.
            - If outside this range, you MUST auto-adjust `take_profit` (never `stop_loss`) to meet the nearest boundary (1.0 or 2.0). You MUST state that you have adjusted it.

        **4f. Final Calculation Cross-Check & Narrative**:
            - **MANDATORY**: After all adjustments, you MUST re-calculate the final `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` in your response using the final `quantized_final_lot_size`.
            - You MUST show this final calculation in your thought process. Example: *"Final Lot: 0.04. The `estimate_loss` is calculated as 0.04 lots * $30 loss/lot = -$1.20."* The `estimate_loss` must be negative.

        **4g. Trailing Stop Loss Processing**:
            - Extract `trailing_stop_loss` from `proposed_signal_json`. Copy the value EXACTLY as provided.

        **STEP 5: INTERNAL CHECKLIST (MUST VERIFY BEFORE OUTPUT)**
        - [ ] Did I perform Step 1 GO/NO-GO checks first and HALT if necessary?
        - [ ] Did I use the correct JPY vs. Non-JPY formula and show my work as required?
        - [ ] Did I apply all sequential adjustments correctly?
        - [ ] Is my final lot size valid (respecting min, max, step, and the HOLD rule)?
        - [ ] Did I enforce the R:R Sanctity Check and adjust TP if needed?
        - [ ] Does my final profit/loss math in the JSON output perfectly match my final cross-check calculation?
        - [ ] Have I populated ALL `thinking_process_*` fields?

        ---
        **CRITICAL ADDITION: VERBOSE THINKING PROCESS**
        You MUST include the following keys in your final JSON output. They must be flat (no nesting) and prefixed with `thinking_process_`. These fields provide a transparent audit trail of your calculations.
        - `thinking_process_step1_pre_flight_check_status`: (string) "GO", "SKIP", or "STOP_TRADE".
        - `thinking_process_step3a_final_risk_percent`: (float) The final risk percentage used for calculation (e.g., 1.2 or 0.8).
        - `thinking_process_step3b_risk_in_usd`: (float) The calculated amount in USD to be risked.
        - `thinking_process_step3b_stop_loss_distance`: (float) The absolute distance between entry and stop loss.
        - `thinking_process_step3b_calculation_path`: (string) "JPY" or "NON-JPY".
        - `thinking_process_step3b_expected_loss_per_lot`: (float) The calculated expected loss for 1.0 lot.
        - `thinking_process_step3b_base_lot_size`: (float) The raw lot size before any adjustments.
        - `thinking_process_step3c_drawdown_factor`: (float) Multiplier for drawdown control (e.g., 0.7 or 1.0 if not applied).
        - `thinking_process_step3c_correlation_factor`: (float) Multiplier for correlation control (e.g., 0.5 or 1.0 if not applied).
        - `thinking_process_step3c_weighted_position_factor`: (float) Multiplier for weighted position control (e.g., 0.7, 0.5, or 1.0 if not applied).
        - `thinking_process_step3c_adjusted_lot_after_factors`: (float) The lot size after all multipliers are applied.
        - `thinking_process_step4a_max_allowed_lot`: (float) The maximum lot size allowed based on account balance tier.
        - `thinking_process_step4a_lot_before_quantization`: (float) Lot size after being capped by `max_allowed_lot`.
        - `thinking_process_step4e_rr_adjustment_details`: (string) "Not needed", "Adjusted TP to 1.0 R:R", or "Adjusted TP to 2.0 R:R".
        - `thinking_process_step4c_hold_rule_verdict`: (string) "HOLD: Lot size too small" or "PASS".

        This detailed process is MANDATORY for debugging and validation purposes. All `thinking_process_*` fields MUST be populated with strings, numbers, or booleans. They MUST NOT be `null` or an empty string, unless the step was skipped entirely (e.g., if status is `STOP_TRADE` in step 1).

        ---
        **STRICT OUTPUT CONSISTENCY RULES (HARD):**
        - The `lot_size` in the final JSON MUST be the `quantized_final_lot_size`.
        - `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` MUST be re-calculated using `quantized_final_lot_size`. `estimate_loss` must be negative.
        - **IF `status` IS `HOLD`, `SKIP`, or `STOP_TRADE`, THEN `lot_size` and all other execution-related fields MUST BE `null`**.
        
        **RETURN JSON ONLY:**
