        **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**
        ---

        **STEP 1: PRE-FLIGHT PORTFOLIO CHECK (GO/NO-GO)**

        **1a. Active Position Limit Check**:
        - Count the number of active orders. If active orders ≥ {max_positions}, your final status MUST be "STOP_TRADE". 
        
        **1b. Same Symbol Active Trade Check**:
        - If an ACTIVE trade on {v_symbol} is already open:
            - If it's LOSING: Forbid a new trade. This prevents averaging down. Status MUST be "SKIP".
            - If it's PROFITABLE: A new trade is only allowed if it's in the SAME direction (scaling-in). If opposite, Status MUST be "SKIP".

        **1c. Same Symbol Pending Order Conflict Check**:
        - This check applies ONLY if the proposed signal is a PENDING order (LIMIT/STOP).
        - If the proposed PENDING signal direction is OPPOSITE to any other existing PENDING order's direction for {v_symbol}, this indicates strategic conflict. Status MUST be "SKIP".

        **1d. Total Unified Portfolio Risk Check (CRITICAL)**:
        - You MUST calculate the total potential monetary loss from all sources (active, pending, and the new signal) and compare it to the `vTotalRiskCap`.
        - **DETAILED EXAMPLE**: Assume `balance` = $1000, `vTotalRiskCap` = 6% ($60), and the new proposed trade has a potential loss of $20 (2%).
            - `potential_loss_active`: From `active_orders_summary`, you find a trade with a pre-defined SL risk of $15. So, `potential_loss_active` = $15.
            - `potential_loss_pending`: From `order_pending_summary`, you see: "- Ticket 123: SELL_STOP GBPUSD 0.05 lots @ 1.2500, SL 1.2530".
                - You calculate the risk: SL is 30 pips. For GBPUSD, 1 pip/0.01 lots = $0.1. So, risk = 30 pips * 5 (for 0.05 lots) * $0.1 = $15.
                - Total `potential_loss_pending` = $15.
            - `potential_loss_new` = $20 (from the proposed signal, which is max {vRisk}%).
            - `total_potential_risk_usd = $15 (active) + $15 (pending) + $20 (new) = $50`.
            - `total_potential_risk_percent = ($50 / $1000) * 100 = 5%`.
            - **Decision**: Since 5% is LESS than `vTotalRiskCap` (6%), the check passes. If `total_potential_risk_usd` was > $60, the status MUST be "STOP_TRADE".
        
        **1e. STRICT STATUS POLICY (MANDATORY)**:
        - "CONTINUE": No stop/skip conditions met.
        - "SKIP": For symbol-scoped disqualifications.
        - "STOP_TRADE": For GLOBAL portfolio conditions (position limit, total risk).

        **STEP 2: IN-DEPTH SIGNAL ANALYSIS**
        *You must formulate and provide answers to these questions in your final JSON output in the `answer_` fields.*
        
        **PASS-THROUGH CONSTRAINTS (STRICT):**
        - You MUST return the field `technical_reasoning` in your final JSON output. Its value MUST be EXACTLY equal to the `technical_reasoning` field in the provided Proposed Signal JSON. If it is missing, return null.

        - **Q1. Signal Viability**: Is this signal strategically sound given current market exposure and correlations? Justify.
        - **Q2. Invalidation Condition**: Beyond the SL price, what would invalidate the core thesis of this trade?
        - **Q3. Capital Adequacy & Max Lot Size Compliance**:
          Calculate the `max_allowed_lot` using the tiered system. State the tier and show the calculation.
          - **Tier 1 (Balance < $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 10000`
          - **Tier 2 (Balance ≥ $1000)**: `max_allowed_lot = balance / 25000`
          - **EXAMPLE**: If balance is $450, you state: "Tier 1 applied. Calculation: 450 / 10000 = 0.045 lots."
          - **EXAMPLE**: If balance is $1200, you state: "Tier 2 applied. Calculation: 1200 / 25000 = 0.048 lots."

        ---
        **STEP 3: LOT SIZE CALCULATION ENGINE**
        *Follow this entire structure precisely for your own calculations, populating the corresponding `debug_` fields.*

        **3a. Determine Base Risk %**:
            - Rule: >70% -> 1.8% | 60-70% -> 1.2% | 50-60% -> 0.8% | <50% -> 0.5%
            - `final_risk_percent` = MIN(Calculated Risk %, {vRisk})

        **3b. Calculate Initial Lot Size (`base_lot_size`)**:
            1.  **Amount to Risk in USD (`risk_in_usd`)**: `account_balance * (final_risk_percent / 100)`
            2.  **Stop Loss in Pips (`stop_loss_in_pips`)**: `abs(entry_price - stop_loss) / pip_size`
            3.  **Expected Loss per Standard Lot (`expected_loss_per_lot`)**: Use Case A, B, or C as appropriate.
            4.  **Base Lot Size (`base_lot_size`)**: `risk_in_usd / expected_loss_per_lot`

        **3c. Apply Portfolio Adjustments**:
            - **CRITICAL EXAMPLE: Applying Multiple Adjustment Factors Sequentially**
            - *This example shows how to handle a complex scenario. You MUST follow this sequential multiplication logic if multiple factors are active.*
            - **Scenario**: `base_lot_size` = `0.10`. Account is in drawdown > 4%. Signal for EURJPY correlates with 2 other active JPY trades. There are 2 active and 4 pending orders.
            1.  **Start with `base_lot_size`**: `current_lot = 0.10`.
            2.  **Apply Drawdown Control**: P/L is < -4%, so apply factor 0.7. `current_lot = 0.10 * 0.7 = 0.07`.
            3.  **Apply Correlation Control**: Correlates with 2+ active orders, so apply factor 0.5. `current_lot = 0.07 * 0.5 = 0.035`.
            4.  **Apply Weighted Position Control**: `effective_positions` = 2 + (4 * 0.33) = 3.32. This is >= 3, so apply factor 0.5. `current_lot = 0.035 * 0.5 = 0.0175`.
            5.  **Final `lot_after_adjustments`**: The final result is `0.0175`. This value is then passed to Step 4.
            - You will record the factors you used (e.g., 1.0 if not active, 0.7 if active) in the `debug_` fields.

        ---
        **STEP 4: FINAL VALIDATION & CHECKS (CRITICAL)**
        
        **4a. Flexible Max Lot Size Cap**:
             - `final_lot_size_before_quantization = MIN(lot_after_adjustments, max_allowed_lot_raw)`.

        **4b. Margin Safety Rules**:
            - Ensure free margin > 50% and total margin usage < 40% of equity.

        **4c. Minimum Lot Size Check**:
            - Check if the `final_lot_size_before_quantization` is less than `symbol_info_json.volume_min`. If so, this leads to a "HOLD" status.
            
        **4d. THE "HOLD" STATUS RULE (MANDATORY)**:
            - If lot size is too small, `status` MUST be `"HOLD"`. IF `status` is `"HOLD"`, then `lot_size` and all execution-related fields MUST be `null`.
            
        **4e. Formatting & Quantization**:
            - Round the `final_lot_size_before_quantization` down to the nearest valid `volume_step`.
            - **Example**: `lot` is `0.0175`, `volume_step` is `0.01`. It rounds down to `0.01`.
            - **Example**: `lot` is `0.029`, `volume_step` is `0.01`. It rounds down to `0.02`.
            - The result is the `quantized_final_lot_size`. This final value goes into the main `lot_size` field.
            - Re-check if `quantized_final_lot_size < volume_min`. If so, apply the "HOLD" rule.

        **4f. Final Calculation Cross-Check**:
            - After all adjustments, you MUST re-calculate and state the final profit/loss based on the `quantized_final_lot_size`. The `estimate_profit` and `estimate_loss` in your JSON output MUST match this math.

        **4g. Risk-to-Reward Ratio Validation & Auto-Adjustment**:
            - It MUST be between 1.0 and 2.0. If outside this range, you MUST adjust `take_profit`.
            - **DETAILED EXAMPLE**:
                - Signal: BUY EURUSD, Entry=1.0800, SL=1.0770 (30 pips), TP=1.0920 (120 pips). R:R is 4.0.
                - `new_take_profit_pips = 30 * 2.0 = 60 pips`.
                - `new_take_profit_price = 1.0800 + (60 * 0.0001) = 1.0860`.
                - You MUST state that you have adjusted TP and use this new value.

        **4h. Trailing Stop Loss Processing**:
            - Extract `trailing_stop_loss` and copy it EXACTLY.
